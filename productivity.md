title: My Productivity System
is_draft: true

I want to share how I think and get things done. Over the years, I've developed this system
for managing my time and knowledge. It's grown naturally, starting from a single markdown file
on my first day at my first job after grad school.

I'm writing this in a descriptive way. I don't think it's the single golden system that will work
for everyone, but it does work for me. And every change I've made to it over the years has been
in response to a need I had in my life.

Now, this system is quite mature and it's still ever-changing. It's most valuable trait is its
adaptability.

Over the years I've developed a pretty significant system for managing my time and knowledge.
That system is tuned to address some of my personal weak points and encourage creative productivity.

I'm always a fan of reading articles and watching videos about other people systems.
Sometimes this is about stealing great ideas. Other times, it's just fun to see how other people think.
I would encourage readers to take this as a descriptive, not prescriptive model of organization.
I've developed a system that works really well for me over several years.
I don't pretend to know the perfect system for every person.

If I were to give some general advice to those seeking to build their own productivity system,
it'd be this: build a system that encourages self-reflection. A good system will reflect on its
own successes and failures to continuously improve.

## Philosophy of the system

- Markdown whenever possible
- Vim-based editing
- Back up with Git
- Adding to the system should have minimal cost
- No note is too short
