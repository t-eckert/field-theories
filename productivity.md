title: How I Work with Thoughts and Time

Over the years I've developed a pretty significant system for managing my time and knowledge.
That system is tuned to address some of my personal weak points and encourage creative productivity.

I'm always a fan of reading articles and watching videos about other people systems.
Sometimes this is about stealing great ideas. Other times, it's just fun to see how other people think.
I would encourage readers to take this as a descriptive, not prescriptive model of organization.
I've developed a system that works really well for me over several years.
I don't pretend to know the perfect system for every person.

If I were to give some general advice to those seeking to build their own productivity system,
it'd be this: build a system that encourages self-reflection. A good system will reflect on its
own successes and failures to continuously improve.
